A Decision Tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that splits the data into different branches (decisions) based on certain criteria.

In this project, I built a Decision Tree model to predict whether a passenger survived on the Titanic based on selected features.

🛠 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱:
- Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
- Selected relevant columns (Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare) as input features.
- Preprocessed the data (handled missing values and label encoding).
- Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split.
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier from sklearn.tree.
- Evaluated the model’s performance using the accuracy score.
